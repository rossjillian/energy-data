# Energy data

The climate impact of machine learning is profound yet poorly understood. As machine learning
researchers, we constantly make choices that affect how carbon intensive our models are.
However, there is no data that enables us to proactively understand the carbon impact of
choosing a certain architecture or training paradigm. We plan to release the first open dataset
mapping energy usage to model metadata, accompanying data analysis and visualizations, and
an interactive website for researchers and practitioners. Our goal is to enable researchers and
practitioners to understand the costs of using different techniques and to guide future research
directions in efficient machine learning.
